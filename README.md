# uCAN


An open-source CAN (Controller Area Network) analyzer based on ESP32-S3, capable of implementing the CAN protocol and Serial Line CAN (SLCAN) protocol for communication over Bluetooth and the serial port. u CAN use it too!

## Introduction

This project aims to create an open-source CAN analysis tool that uses ESP32S3 to capture and decode CAN messages, as well as provide Serial Line CAN (SLCAN) functionality for communication with other devices.

## Features

- Implementation of the CAN protocol.
- Support for the Serial Line CAN (SLCAN) protocol.
- Communication via Bluetooth.
- Communication via the serial port.
- Capturing and displaying CAN messages.
- Decoding CAN messages.
- Detailed documentation.

## Requirements

- [ESP-IDF](https://github.com/espressif/esp-idf) - Development framework for ESP32.
- [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software) (optional) - For programming the ESP32S3.
